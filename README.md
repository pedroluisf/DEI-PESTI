##Project Description

The AppTour project is a proposal to provide real time information to
tourists, when visiting a location.

The idea is to provide information that is usually dispersed on the Internet as well as the one that can be provided through partners in a centralised way, pretty much as an indexer, but focusing on the categories considered to be relevant for tourism.

It also tries to provide Information that is relevant when queried by filtering and simplifying the vast Information that exists and bringing to the user only the one that is relevant at the time and place where he is. This approach we call the concept “Right Here, Right Now”.

The application acts as a virtual guide and tries to satisfy the doubts about a city, for locals or foreigners.

The project consists of a central repository that serves both a Web Portal as also Web Services, that in turn will be consumed by an android native app. The data is inserted manually by the users of the application or automatically through the use of agents.

These agents will “feed” on known sources, each of them specific for certain categories that will aggregate the information that is public in the internet. The Agents are built in order to allow for  easy scaling and the creation of new Agents as new sources are discovered or available.
